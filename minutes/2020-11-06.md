Attendees:

- Tristan Sloughter
- Fred Hebert
- Todd Resudek
- Eric Meadows-Jonsson
- John Hogberg
- Bryan Paxton
- Wojtek Mach

1. erlup and elixirup
2. Github actions for binary releases (merged the first two)

- Installation of pre-compiled erlang binaries being discussed. Kenneth mentioned Github actions that could be used for it.
- Wojtek Mach wants specifically statically compiled build (i.e. on OSX with statically-linked open-ssl) // Freds adds in Wx as another painful one
- OTP point releases are already all getting binary builds for windows
- Gotta figure out who can commit to part of it?
    - Tristan maybe has limited time
    - Wojtek Mach can help
- Official docker/elixir images have been moved to the foundation since the previous maintainer stopped responding
    - we have control of the repos on dockerhub
    - we could ensure there's a working-group chair email setup and use it for contacts on dockerhub to avoid getting direct mail
- We could figure out if we can manage to merge the various builder repos

3. Build rebar3 locally without downloading dependencies (“source only”)

- Ericsson would require internal builds for security reasons they would need to be built from source without the network
- This is required for rebar3 and projects depending on rebar3
    - only git dependencies in their case
- We could have a sort of vendoring mechanisms that doesn't talk to the network
- Action item: make plans for a hermetic mode (fred to dig up older issues)
    - all I had was a vague plan in: https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/issues/1777 
    - How we got it working for one person: https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/issues/2172

4. Mix self-hosting improvements:  `mix hex.registry build` & `hex_registry:build/1`

- Have an official way of building the registry
- Could be useful for development and other projects

5. Mix+Rebar3 and bare compile sparse dirs

- Open Telemetry uses sparse checkouts, and when mix builds that, it doesn't have the open-telemetry part in the path. The sparse checkout part may not be appended to the path sent back to rebar3 when calling `rebar3 bare compile`
- Eric sees like there'd be no reason for it not to work
- Needs to have an offline investigation by Eric

6. RFC : UX for user registration in hex and rebar3_hex:

- It would be nice if the way the user interacts between rebar3 and mix hex is the same. Agreement would be good
- About prompting users for passwords. Mix hex and r3 hex, if you are prompted for account information, it just bails if you mismatch
    - we should probably prompt again instead
- having it in hex_core could be a good idea? Wojtek has good points on not sharing that logic, and may not fit hex_core (never gonna have interactions on a server?)
    - getting passwords in the CLI is just messy
    - a utility library for some functionality could be good, but hard to unite between both tools
- may make sense to write a user-flow for new behaviours, like a product spec
- Bryan happy to make a PR to unify the flows in mix and rebar3 for users handling
- You can sign up to hex through the website but it would be nice to be able to do it through the terminal as well and unify flows there

7. Better support for Elixir deps in non-elixir projects: 

- rebar_mix plugins + another project for that, that we keep hoping could merge
- very tricky issue on the background, and types of compilers, we might need to think on it
- adding a new interface on plugins for direct deps to let us reintegrate them in the flow of multi-app build files

8. Build-time and optional applications annotations

- mostly added to the agenda for awareness
- José showed up late to say it's mostly done
- are the new changes in line with hex? yes: OTP changes are mostly for release assembly. Works through the app file.
    - might require integration work from rebar3 when publishing things so the info is available

9. Breaking changes in OTP-24

- Already had an issue: do a compile for each OTP and Elixir version supported
- Rebar3 may need to do the same
- Compatibility is in the source code but not on the shipped artifacts
- Hex has a similar archive issue
- the rebar3 shipping pre-compiled with hex will have issues as well, needs to implemented
- hex_core fix to be shipped around early next week since an API disappeared

- Side point on patterns for discoverable declarative code
