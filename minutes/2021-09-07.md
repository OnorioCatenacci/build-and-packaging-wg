* Fred Hebert
* Radek Szymczysyn
* Bryan Paxton (2nd half)

Agenda:

* Q3 report? Could be filled earlier 
* Hex doc update:
    * Wojtek did a bunch of progress in general; generating the OTP docs themselves are now generating, very few things and minor details remaining (i.e. how to handle specs)
    * Some projects are starting to use hex docs as well, telemetry is the most notable one. There’s a small script to wrap and use to publish.
        * If someone would look for a rebar3 integration, this could be the time for that. Executables through the github releases could be used.
* Rebar3: new release
* rebar3_hex next major (v7) still in progress, aligns with Elixir’s stuff to be more consistent
    * Hoping to get a PR a day, swamped with other work
* Radek wants to pick brains about build tools and gradualizer
    * Demo given over zoom, with Feedback coming with it
* People using the zig compiler to compile beam; easy cross-compilation.
