- PR open, awaiting feedback, https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2936

2. **[TS]** Github Actions setup-erlang/setup-elixir
3. **[FH]** Code Beam V

- Having a list of things we’ve done in 2020 might be useful

4. **[WM]** Bunch of functions removed in crypto

- Replacements were added in OTP-22, but a lot of projects were still using them (i.e. HMAC)
- Two years is “Normal” for the OTP team
- Rebar3 might need to adjust its policies to match that

5. **[FH]** Autoconf in OTP
