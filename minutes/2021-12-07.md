# Dec 7

We changed the meeting schedule and got some confusion, only part of the working group attended

Attendees:

* Fred Hebert
* Kenneth Lundin
* John Hogberg
* Viktor Soderqvist

Agenda

* Offline builds for Erlang

Notes:

* Change of schedule with trailing invites confused a bunch of people who did not attend the same meeting as the four present here did.
* Offline builds:
  * Migrating some Ericsson projects internally 
     * Needs to be using the tarball from the github release
        * Need for a new resource handler (http resource / tarball)
     * Needs to be able to keep local patches to dependencies
        * These are not deps anymore
     * Could Ericsson use a local hex index?
        * Not liking to have language-specific indices within the organization

Action Item:
* Fred to try a few things vendoring-like with various source directories and their behaviour vs. deps, and to report back in the related github issue.
