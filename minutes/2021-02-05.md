1. **[JV]** Does the agenda go here or on github?

- https://github.com/erlef/eef-build-and-packaging-wg/issues 
- Intended to help clarify, the idea is to transfer these minutes to the repository
- These issues can be broken down into Action items and Agenda items
  - Action items will have tasks, meanwhile Agenda have objectives
- Agenda items should be created for them to be discussed during the next meeting. Once its objectives have been completed, the issue can be closed and an Action item can be created.
  - Fred: to groom backlog and update invites to make it easy to switch to the new one 

3. **[JV]** Merge with docs working group

- Change the mission from "To evolve the tools in the ecosystem related to building and deploying code, with a strong focus on interoperability between BEAM languages" to "To evolve the tools in the ecosystem related to building, documenting, and deploying code, with a strong focus on interoperability between BEAM languages."
- Add new Main Objectives: "Improve the user experience in generating and accessing documentation from the shell, IDEs, web pages, etc."
- Tooling work is all that’s left for the docs folks, so we should be folding the group within tools efforts.
- Action items:
  - José: provide the list of people coming over
  - Fred/Tristan: to update the charter and invite lists to events
  - José: sync with board members to announce the merger and stuff

4. **[JH]** New compilation/build model:

- Current model is that the Erlang compiler only looks at the file being compiled, leaving “linking” for later (load time), which is somewhat similar to C and works well in makefiles and manual command-line builds. This is fine in principle.

  Unfortunately -include(), -include_lib(), parse transformations, and -behavior() look beyond the file in ill-defined ways which complicates dependency management and makes it difficult to parallelize builds. We can’t tear these features out altogether, but they could be better supported with a new build model.

  We hope to start exploring this soon after OTP 24 is released, and I’d like to have the WG on board from the start.
- New Compilation / Build Models:
  - Includes, include-lib and parse transforms complexify the model a lot, and the compiler consults the code path very often which severely restricts what we can do (can’t parallelize builds)
  - For OTP-25 John will have time to tackle that, and a new compilation model needs to be thought of. We want everything that goes within compilation to be known beforehand and passed to the compiler (no looking for header files, modules in code path, build tools pass that to the compiler)
  - Rebar3 folks have definitely wanted that; any prior art
  - Should open a discussion with Elixir, Erlang, and Caramel (Leandro) about that
    - We might need to redefine new lines of abstraction for the ownership of the graph of dependencies between build tools and the compiler
    - Elixir has a more complicated compile time model than Erlang, where they do everything in parallel, and when they hit a constraint for scheduling, they dynamically figure it out at runtime
    - Action item: to open a discussion thread to do the fact gathering (Tristan to open discussions)

5. **[TR]** Release of Hex Preview

- A bridge between doc and build tools where you can review the changes to hex packages (particularly useful since the source links are optional and not necessarily authoritative
- Tell Todd if there are issues with Erlang files and how they’re rendered
- https://preview.hex.pm
- https://github.com/hexpm/preview

7. **[WM]** Removing code that updates the deprecated registry v1 (https://github.com/hexpm/hexpm/pull/1003)

- A year ago we stopped updating the old registry file, the code for it will be removed soon
- Expected breakage: no breakage expected, unless they’re using very old build tools, but there’s a clear migration path in that case.
