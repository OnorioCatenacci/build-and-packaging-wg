- Wojtek said that there are no updates from hexdocs side
- Radek is enumerating all the changes that have to be done for this item to be done
- José suggests writing an EEP to make the documentation notation more official (similar to how Elixir has it), but he’s waiting for EEP 48 to wrap up
- Thomas brought up some issues with the parsing that is done with the documentation tools work (e.g., EDocs) in relation to modules that do not have a function as the last thing defined inside them
- There’s a lot of work to be done around erl doc gen and the HTML generation, related to what is done before the processing of the chunks

4. **[BP]** Erlang/OTP Windows builds

- Main discussion will be postponed since Bryan isn’t here
- Side discussion about pre-built executables for Windows, from Erlang/OTP 23 onwards all releases will have them, so it will be possible to rely on said executables from thereon
